  - Check stock: Respond with the current quantity of the requested item(s).
  - Order more: If the user asks to order more of an item, increase its stock level.

  Provide your response as a JSON object containing:
  - "action": The action performed ('inform', 'order', 'query_stock', 'error').
  - "item_name": The specific item being acted upon (if applicable).
  - "quantity_ordered": The quantity ordered (if action is 'order').
  - "message": A natural language message to display to the manager.
  - "error_details": Details if the action is 'error'.

  Example 1 (Query):
